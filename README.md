# End-to-end-case-analysis-on-Perception-of-Indian-consumers-towards-perfumes-and-fragrances

## Problem statement:
Perfumes and Fragrances have a significant influence on the consumer behaviour and yet there is a lack of deep understanding about the factors that shape the consumers’ perception of perfumes and fragrances in the market. 

## Objective of study:
The objective of this study is to know the most likely used brand among the small set of consumers. Also, it aims to gather the information on the frequency of usage of perfumes, purchasing modes, monthly spendings and impact of perfumes on consumer behaviour which is vital for study.

## Data collection:
The data is collected through Google forms from various people residing in Karnataka, India. It includes people from various age groups and professions. There are 50 respondents to this survey.

## Data methodology:
1.	Collection of data.
2.	Performing Descriptive Statistics for the collected data through JMP Pro software.
3.	Data analysis using Graph builder in JMP and using Distributions.
4.	Using Factor Analysis to obtain the results (Dimension reduction).
5.	Using Clustering method by K-means.
6.  Obtaining Biplot 3D.
7.  Using Fit Y by X to obtain results
8.  Analysing and interpreting the results.
9.  Deriving inference out of the results obtained.

## Data analysis and interpretations:
### Age:

Inference: Most of the consumers who use perfumes belong to the age group of 21-25. The survey was mostly conducted for this particular age group to know whether they use the perfumes in how much numbers.

### Gender:

Inference: Out of 50 people among whom survey was conducted, 66% of them are students while the remaining are working professionals.

### Perfume usage:

Inference: It is found that 86% of the people wear perfumes while the remaining 14% do not prefer perfumes.

### Liking towards perfumes:

![img5](https://github.com/dhanashreehampiholi/trial/assets/57892263/607be856-e154-4dd2-a968-125c9bce0de3)

Inference: From the above analysis, it is evident that the consumers are of neutral opinion towards their liking on perfumes.

### Conciousness:

Inference: It is seen that many consumers do not agree to the statement that applying perfumes makes people notice one more and makes one look more confident.

### Perfume intensity

Inference: It is observed that most of the consumers a medium smell of fragrance of the perfume.

### Satisfaction

Inference: It is observed that most of the consumers are happy with the brand of perfume they  use and are satisfied with it.

### Snobbery:

![img9](https://github.com/dhanashreehampiholi/trial/assets/57892263/00aa2c11-b994-45a2-aaea-38c59566479e)

Inference: It is observed that, not many people believe that statement that higher the cost of perfumes, the better the fragrance. Many of them are of the opinion that even perfumes with economic or standard cost can also have a better fragrance. The price need not be always premium for it. 

### Frequency of usage:

![img10](https://github.com/dhanashreehampiholi/trial/assets/57892263/1e53c073-4f76-4c46-b801-4b271b3cace4)

Inference: It is seen that 44%  of the consumers wear the perfumes on daily basis. While there are 32% of the consumers who rarely use perfumes or do not use at all.

### Brand:

Inference: Of all the types and brands used by consumers, Fogg is used in majority. Or out of every 50 consumers of perfumes and fragrances, 7 of them use Fogg brand, followed by Yardley. Also for every 50 consumers there are 5 consumers who do not use perfumes at all.


### Monetory value:

![img12](https://github.com/dhanashreehampiholi/trial/assets/57892263/5be9c675-dba5-4f89-b109-85dad782ab81)

Inference: It is seen that the average spending of the consumers on perfumes and fragrances lies in an around Rs.800. 

### Mode of purchase:

![img13](https://github.com/dhanashreehampiholi/trial/assets/57892263/bfb9c98f-6224-46b6-bce5-a903583bd5ea)

Inference: It is evident from the above data, that 68% of the consumers prefer buying perfumes from the physical stores than the online stores.

## Clustering
The next step in analysis is to use K-means method of clustering. 

Clustering is a method of grouping the set of consumers such that similar ones belong to the same group.The number of clusters selected for the analysis of Perfumes and Fragrances is 3. 

![img14](https://github.com/dhanashreehampiholi/trial/assets/57892263/8c368aec-51a4-492a-90ef-34201a39b10c)

![img15](https://github.com/dhanashreehampiholi/trial/assets/57892263/fbb6f929-2b74-4167-8c3b-4151bf9a55e8)

Then a Biplot 3D for the above clusters is obtained as follows:

![img16](https://github.com/dhanashreehampiholi/trial/assets/57892263/a3d849ec-b58e-4fa1-a90d-fded19903ebd)

The obtained clusters can be grouped and named as:

Cluster 1 : Premium customers.

Cluster 2 : Standard customers.

Cluster 3 : Economic customers.

## Dimension Reduction:

### Factor Analysis of Cluster 1:

Factor Analysis on Correlation with 2 factors: 

Cluster 1 – Premium customers

![img18](https://github.com/dhanashreehampiholi/trial/assets/57892263/c2a7544a-c016-4a2b-9417-973d521977e0)

![img19](https://github.com/dhanashreehampiholi/trial/assets/57892263/bc8779f3-83b7-4a95-a381-30a6f4a47cb0)

Premuim customers are a set of people who strongly believe that wearing Perfumes boosts their confidence. They use the perfumes on daily basis and their  average  monthly spending on perfumes is as high as Rs.3600.

### Factor Analysis of Cluster 2:

![img20](https://github.com/dhanashreehampiholi/trail/assets/57892263/4eb281e0-d4bb-4fa9-b23c-ef57c194b2d7)

Factor Analysis on Correlation with 3 factors: 

Cluster 2 – Standard customers

![img21](https://github.com/dhanashreehampiholi/trail/assets/57892263/2e4efeea-a278-4cde-8cd3-e806208946ee)

![img22](https://github.com/dhanashreehampiholi/trail/assets/57892263/1042d766-c61e-46a1-b4d2-634e3d028bfa)

Standard customers represent a set of people who believe that wearing perfumes boost the confidence of individuals only under few circumstances. They use perfumes frequently(weekly, bi-weekly) but are not daily users Also the average spending of these customers is around Rs.600.

### Factor Analysis of Cluster 3:

![img23](https://github.com/dhanashreehampiholi/trail/assets/57892263/e8552cec-bd09-48fe-afdb-399cee9d8f73)

Factor Analysis on Correlation with 2 factors: 

Cluster 3- Economic customers

![img24](https://github.com/dhanashreehampiholi/trail/assets/57892263/2229baf9-119c-4414-8198-3af503d655a1)

![img25](https://github.com/dhanashreehampiholi/trail/assets/57892263/a4fe60fd-60df-4e1d-b8bb-54488eb08491)

Economic customers represent a set of people who use perfumes seldomly or do not use at all. Their confidence is not affected by external factors(Perfumes and fragrances) and their average monthly spending is very less i.e. around Rs.250.

## Model Building

### Fit Y by X: For Premium customers

![img26](https://github.com/dhanashreehampiholi/trail/assets/57892263/f1f4407d-68fe-4b49-9adc-f06ea8cc0957)

![img27](https://github.com/dhanashreehampiholi/trail/assets/57892263/1b435ceb-fa0b-4876-8285-b7e99dd6f8b8)

Inference: Since the ‘p’ value for Premium customers is not less than 0.05, the model is not a good fit.

### Fit Y by X : Standard Customers

![img28](https://github.com/dhanashreehampiholi/trail/assets/57892263/70a2cc40-ec24-46b6-80ff-21744c1af380)

![img29](https://github.com/dhanashreehampiholi/trail/assets/57892263/be056f77-a151-4eab-a357-0d260e1bf690)

Inference: Since the ‘p’ value for Standard customers is not less than 0.05, the model is not a good fit.

### Fit Y by X : Economic Customers

![img30](https://github.com/dhanashreehampiholi/trail/assets/57892263/b7c7f052-fc38-4575-9cc4-c3643c75209b)

![img31](https://github.com/dhanashreehampiholi/trail/assets/57892263/5b291a4d-cb60-43bc-91af-d2b611fec36f)

Inference: Since the ‘p’ value forEconomic customers is not less than 0.05,the model is not a good fit.

## Findings:
The consumers can be classified in 3 categories as Premium customers, Standard customers and Economic customers. Huge number of customers belong to Standard group. They spend in the range of Rs.600 to Rs.800 on the perfumes and are of neutral perception on the impact of perfumes on their confidence levels. Also it can be seen that univariate and bivariate analysis methods do not help in efficient model building.
